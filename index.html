        <p>When I was in fourth, and my SA-2 was over then we were preparing for our last school presentation in which we showed that what we did in the school for the whole yoear. And all the students were going in there hobby that what they like and through that particular hobby they would explain the presentation. At that time, I even didn't knew what was my hobby and bymistake, I went in the auditorium amd their, the dance sir was preparing the interested students of dance and one of them was missing.They thought that the one who was missing is me.Then what, I have to learn dance and I don't know what to do else and my class teacher said that every student has to participate. Then I Practised it for 2 or 3 days , then I got interset in it. And after three days, the boy came who was missing. So the dance sir decided that the boy who was missing would be in center. As he was the best dancing in the fourth grade. Then I felt bad and started practising so well that the dance sir put me in the center and that boy in the corner. And after the annual presentation of fourth grade, I was known the best dancer in the school and whenever there is a dance practice for any special day, my school dance sir go in my classroom and take my name for dance practice. One time, my dance told only told me to prepare the in 2 days. I just love dance.
